1
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:58,199
The fumes of the dead
hung in the air like poison.

2
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:05,609
A plague more cruel and more pitiless
than war had descended upon us.

3
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:11,211
A pestilence
that would leave half our kingdom dead.

4
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,463
Where did it come from?

5
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:20,461
What carried it's germ?

6
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,882
The priests told us
it was God's punishment.

7
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,250
For what sin?

8
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:29,777
What commandment must we break
that would earn this?

9
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,752
No, we knew the truth.

10
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,669
This was not God's work,
but devilry.

11
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,088
Or witchcraft.

12
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,752
And our task, to hunt down a demon,
is God's cure.

13
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,287
Brother Thomas.

14
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,637
Brother Thomas.

15
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:06,653
- Who was taken from us?
- Brother Ignatius.

16
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,716
- Is it the pestilence?
- We have not been told.

17
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:13,794
I have no signs.
Please brother.

18
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:17,078
Let me out.

19
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,849
Averill.

20
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,756
O thanks pretty gorgeous.

21
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:55,048
- Where have you been?
- I was confined... sacred.

22
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:03,544
I thought you were dead.

23
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:07,296
- I am alright.
- I prayed, prayed all the time.

24
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:09,366
I am alright.

25
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:12,777
I have brought food.

26
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:21,874
One of our brothers
died this morning, Averill.

27
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:25,092
Even the monastery is no longer safe,
you must go now.

28
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:29,168
You must go back to Dentwich Forest and
you must hide there till this is passed.

29
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:35,756
On Sunday the prior said the pestilence was
God's new purge, send to wash away our sins.

30
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,081
- Is God punishing us?
- No.

31
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:41,261
No.

32
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:47,980
You must go now.

33
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:50,870
You must go back to Dentwich.

34
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,940
You must go.

35
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:17,879
- Osmund, I...
- Averill, you will die.

36
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:20,291
And you will not?

37
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,162
Come with me.

38
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:31,037
If I leave the monastery now,
I betray God.

39
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,539
We have already betrayed him.

40
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:19,363
You know the Martyrs Cross
at Dentwich forest?

41
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:24,178
I will wait for you there,
every morning at dawn for one week.

42
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,469
And then I will be gone.

43
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,712
Forgive me, Father. I am confused.

44
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,435
I confess, I am torn.

45
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,066
Can I serve you outside of these walls?

46
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,189
I would leave here, but I would never
stray from your grace, father.

47
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,420
Show me Your will.

48
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:29,623
Father, give me a sign.

49
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,054
I am Ulric, envoy to the bishop.

50
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:12,916
What I say
now does not leave these walls.

51
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,769
Word has reached the bishop of a village
that does not suffer as the rest.

52
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:23,142
They say it is a sanctuary
from the pestilence.

53
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:28,263
There are many villages that have not
been ravaged yet by the pestilence.

54
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:32,389
It is claimed these villagers
are beyond it's icy grasp.

55
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,054
Then they are greatly mistaken.

56
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:41,765
These are difficult times.

57
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:45,255
Such claims however fantastical...

58
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:49,887
can find favor with those
less educated than you or I.

59
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:54,759
Precisely why we cannot fall foul
of rumor and superstition.

60
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:57,595
God's grip on his people is lucent.

61
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:02,941
We must ensure the flock is not tempted
to look beyond God and church for answers.

62
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:08,385
I must see for myself
how this village is kept safe.

63
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,594
What part have we in this?

64
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,782
The village I seek
lies in the great marsh.

65
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:17,209
I require a guide, a man of God,
to show the way.

66
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,509
No man here fit for such a task.

67
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:25,882
With the bishop's blessing
I may choose any man here.

68
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,591
Out of respect....
I grant you that choice

69
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,040
I will lead you there.

70
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:37,082
No, he is a mere novice.
This requires a more experienced hand.

71
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,709
Let him speak.

72
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:41,005
The said village you seek
lies in the great marsh.

73
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,714
I was raised
close by in Dentwich Forest.

74
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:47,211
I know the area better than any man.

75
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,504
He has all the experience I require.

76
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,590
You will lead us.
We leave at dawn.

77
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:01,953
Osmund, that man is more dangerous
than the pestilence itself.

78
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:04,660
Father, I prayed for guidance.

79
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,423
God has answered.

80
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:29,783
Even if you survive,
the world out there will change you.

81
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,571
Perhaps that's what I want Father.

82
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,195
My lady love and I,
we lived in joyous sin,

83
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,489
now my lady love has
got the blackened skin.

84
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,570
My lady love and I,
we pour our love so brave,

85
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:09,064
now my lady love rots in an
early grave.

86
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,978
We have our guide.

87
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:38,352
God has no men left,

88
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,440
he sends us a boy.

89
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,610
Are you up to it, son?

90
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,728
I can lead you there.

91
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,683
Pray you do.

92
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,394
Split any man from his
asshole to his apple.

93
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,684
What's that for?

94
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,524
How much does he know?

95
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:02,968
Ulric was, ahh, 'frugal' shall we say
with the truth.

96
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:07,802
This village we're headed to...

97
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:12,680
they have cast God aside.
In his place sits a demon.

98
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:18,596
There was talk of sacrifice of men
eating men and of raising the dead.

99
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:19,806
Now we're charged...

100
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:23,453
to bring the leader of this village back
for confession, trial and execution.

101
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:26,593
The bishop seeks to roast them kimself
a necromancer.

102
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,157
Sorry, what is a necromancer?

103
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:32,679
A necromancer is someone who plucks
the dead from the cold earth,

104
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:35,300
breathes new life into them.

105
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,092
We have the tools, we have the will.

106
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:41,469
We journey into hell.

107
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,097
- But God travels with us.
- So you misled me.

108
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,280
Return to your monastery
if you feel betrayed...

109
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,094
or join us and do God's work.

110
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:55,259
Let's get this cleared up,
let's get going.

111
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:59,015
That includes you, Swire.

112
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,292
We are not as bad as you think.

113
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:49,998
But worse.
But we need you alive.

114
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,917
You seem well suited to
keeping men alive.

115
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:58,583
I have spent many a long years in the
king's army with Wolfstan and Griff.

116
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,029
I will be honest with you.

117
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,197
We have never faced a demon before,
but we take what comes our way.

118
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:08,002
- What happened to him?
- Ivo was captured.

119
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:12,751
Wouldn't talk, so the bastard French
tore out his tongue.

120
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,332
- And him?
- Mold is a man to leave alone.....

121
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:20,333
unless there's butchery to be done.

122
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:24,589
And Dalywag, he is a torturer,
a hangman,

123
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,703
and if the rumor is true, murderer,
thief and deceiver of women.

124
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,374
But apart from that he's a good man.

125
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:36,336
- What about Ulric?
- I have got a wife and child.

126
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:42,293
I am here for the money. Ulric is here,
because God told him to come.

127
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,533
- Burn.
- What's it...

128
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,452
Have mercy, please have mercy.
No.

129
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,785
I have done nothing.

130
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:10,903
- We must help her.
- Do you here me? You deserve to burn.

131
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:14,735
- I have done nothing.
- Burn. Burn the witch. Burn.

132
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,245
- You're in league with the devil.
- What is her crime?

133
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,135
She brought death to our village.

134
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,740
Death is all around us,
and it's no invitation.

135
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,887
This does not involve you monk.
Step aside.

136
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,659
I have done nothing, please.

137
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,696
Please, stand aside.

138
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:37,282
What is this woman accused of?

139
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,304
She poisoned our well in a pact with
the devil, now half the village is dead.

140
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:43,777
I offered a simple blessing over
our water to keep everyone safe.

141
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:45,948
- Liar.
- I did nothing wrong.

142
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,053
The dying began
after she was seen at the well.

143
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:48,991
You have her confession?

144
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:51,719
Plenty of us saw her cast her spell.
Now she must burn,

145
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:54,719
to spare what remains of our village.

146
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:58,484
Move aside.

147
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:05,857
I will not ask you again.

148
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,862
Back.

149
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:29,064
Thank you.

150
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,683
Do not stop again.

151
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,098
Come on, brown slug.

152
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:08,932
As sure as the sun will rise and fall,
witches will burn.

153
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:14,222
There's a village in the north,
that burned 128 witches in one night.

154
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:17,806
That's sixteen an hour, for eight hours.

155
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:22,561
By the time that night was through,
they'd killed every woman in the village.

156
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:25,936
By the end of that week
the men were shagging pigs.

157
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:31,348
Pestilence isn't trial enough,
now God has us shagging pigs.

158
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:35,893
This village we seek, you been there?

159
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:39,598
No, but I know where it lies.

160
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:42,513
Hell awaits us, or so we're told.

161
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:45,283
If you have not got the stomach for it,
then leave it now.

162
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:47,576
And I will have your share
of the bounty.

163
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:51,967
What is the Church believe
this pestilence is come from?

164
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:55,595
I don't believe God
is punishing us like many do.

165
00:20:55,807 --> 00:21:00,593
I say from France,
where all foul things emerge.

166
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:04,716
For once Swire,
you might not be too far from the truth.

167
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,596
Three summers passed,
we fought a battle at Crecy in Normandy,

168
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,672
King Edward's army was dwarfed.

169
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,735
For every 20 of us,
there were a 100 Frenchmen, at least.

170
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,263
The French...

171
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,880
Ah, the French.

172
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,676
They could sense victory,
you could smell it.

173
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:30,129
On that day for the first time
our archers used the longbow.

174
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:33,094
Quicker to load, further in flight.

175
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:37,547
Their arrows, their arrows were useless.
Couldn't reach us.

176
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:42,418
And ours, ours were like a dark,
buzzing cloud.

177
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:48,174
And that day's end, field was littered
with their dead and their dying.

178
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:53,666
And custom no matter how fierce the
battle, was to use the misericorde.

179
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:56,667
Misericorde, it's the mercy-giver.

180
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:00,297
You stab straight through the armpit
directly into the heart.

181
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:01,653
It's quick and painless.

182
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,624
But on this day,
there was an end to chivalry.

183
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:11,590
King Edward ordered every Frenchman
left alive to be killed without mercy.

184
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:16,792
Arms, heads, legs...

185
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:19,080
hacked away.

186
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:24,452
God's greatest army descended into savagery.

187
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:31,292
Forgive me, but how does that
concern the pestilence?

188
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:34,537
We invited Death among us that day.

189
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,834
He hasn't left us since.

190
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:11,499
That woman you killed,

191
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:14,162
she was not a witch.

192
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,113
Why did you volunteer to join us,
monk?

193
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:23,617
To serve God.

194
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:26,698
Killing witches serves God.

195
00:23:27,746 --> 00:23:30,615
The woman was already dead.

196
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:32,451
If I had freed her,

197
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:35,368
the mob would have caught her again
and burned her.

198
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:40,282
I spared her suffering.

199
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:46,193
Sometimes that is all you can do.

200
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:15,022
He says: "turn back."

201
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:19,095
Where we're headed
men have become savages.

202
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:52,935
It must have been something
pretty special,

203
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:55,853
to tempt you away from that nice,
warm monastery.

204
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,427
- Anything you want to tell me?
- No.

205
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,346
You know what my job is?

206
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:20,762
I am a torturer, truth-getter.
Spend hours on a man.

207
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:25,074
Can smell a lie, and I smell you.

208
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:27,962
Pray somewhere else, if I were you.

209
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,414
Have you broken any vows yet, boy?

210
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:18,463
Leave him be, Mold.

211
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:24,706
Back, get back.
Griff.

212
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,497
Griff?

213
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:34,830
- I said: Get Back.
- Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

214
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:36,998
Let me look.

215
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,766
Let me look.

216
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:45,251
Just going to take a look.

217
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:52,668
Alright? Okay my friend.
Just having a look.

218
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,284
Why didn't you tell us?

219
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:31,695
I am sorry.

220
00:28:32,246 --> 00:28:35,195
His journey is finished here.

221
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,409
I prefer mercy.

222
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,197
I need to make
a confession to the friar.

223
00:28:49,197 --> 00:28:50,344
No...

224
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:55,688
...cannot be sure how this thing spread.
- Who the hell asked you?

225
00:28:58,493 --> 00:29:01,241
I will take your confession.

226
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:05,110
Come, you shall have absolution.

227
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:14,194
You keep your mouth shut.

228
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:29,483
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis in nomine
patris et filii et spiritus sancti.

229
00:29:29,483 --> 00:29:31,269
Forgive me.

230
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:38,354
Our Father who art in Heaven...

231
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,901
Hallowed be thy name...

232
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:46,267
Come thy kingdom, forfilled be thine
when in heaven as in earth...

233
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:49,547
bread give us today...

234
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,981
I need a moment with him.

235
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,101
Alright.

236
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:18,707
I am glad it's you.
I can see things... Urgh...

237
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:32,808
Farewell my friend.

238
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:49,386
Bury him.

239
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:26,800
- The forest of Dentwich.
- How far to the marsh?

240
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:29,049
Half a day, perhaps less.

241
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:34,137
Be on your guard.
God has slipped over the horizon.

242
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,126
You're on watch tonight, Swire.

243
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:02,879
Giving Griff absolution...

244
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:06,379
...took courage.

245
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:17,662
Do you truly believe
this village can rise the dead?

246
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:20,722
I would not be here otherwise.

247
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,394
You doubt it?

248
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:27,441
I believe that hunting
necromancers and demons...

249
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,838
serves men more than it serves god.

250
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:35,498
You have learned much
nestled inside the monastery.

251
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,118
Demons and necromancers are among us.

252
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,857
As you will find out.

253
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,441
Soon enough.

254
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,077
I will get some sleep.

255
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,734
Averill.

256
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,275
Averill.

257
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:11,531
Averill.

258
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:26,945
Averill?

259
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:40,129
No.

260
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:55,064
No, no, no. No.

261
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,690
Averill.

262
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:21,649
Wake up.

263
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,797
Ulric.

264
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,045
Get up.

265
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:25,606
Wolfstan.

266
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,773
Ulric, wake up.
Wake up. Ulric.

267
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:30,431
- How many are in the forest?
- Calm down.

268
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,307
How many? What did you see?
What did you see?

269
00:35:32,307 --> 00:35:34,097
- They're in the forest. I don't...
- How many? How many?

270
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:35,556
I don't know. I don't know.

271
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:37,130
- How many?
- He doesn't know.

272
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:52,351
Mold, forward, now.

273
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:11,640
Wait. Wait.

274
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:56,965
Get in there.
Now.

275
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:27,054
Yah, shut the fuck...

276
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:45,103
No.

277
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:54,715
God. God.

278
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:16,528
Where is Ivo?

279
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:25,280
You alright?

280
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,196
We lost Ivo.

281
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,317
Why did you leave the camp?

282
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:48,277
Speak.

283
00:39:49,903 --> 00:39:52,735
- I came her to meet a woman.
- And where is she?

284
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:55,398
She did not survive the forest.

285
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:59,403
God has punished me
for leaving his monastery.

286
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,976
God has better things to think of.

287
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:07,107
Because of you...

288
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,773
one of my men is dead.

289
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:18,688
If we move, we move now.

290
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:21,056
How do we know
the man we have come for is not here?

291
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:23,810
These men are nothing more
than common thieves.

292
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:29,315
- You will lead us to the great marsh.
- Sir, I am of no use to you.

293
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,894
You will lead us...

294
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,398
or stay here alone and be damned.

295
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,803
The village lies beyond the marsh.

296
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,091
What's the plan?

297
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:20,673
Identify the heretic...

298
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,571
capture him...

299
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:24,038
put him in the cage.

300
00:41:24,038 --> 00:41:27,753
- That will never go across the marsh.
- Then we will leave it behind.

301
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:31,131
Drag him here.

302
00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:53,123
Come on, boy.

303
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,210
Come on.

304
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:14,392
What brings you to our village?

305
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:20,230
We seek refuge.

306
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:23,147
A place to rest, nothing more.

307
00:45:24,649 --> 00:45:26,685
Then you are welcome.

308
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,971
My name is Hob.

309
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,182
I am Ulric.

310
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:46,355
You were attacked?

311
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:47,892
In the forest.

312
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:52,267
Then you did well to reach us.
That forest can be dangerous.

313
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,306
- May I ask what you were doing?
- Bringing relief to the suffering.

314
00:45:56,518 --> 00:45:58,475
Relief?

315
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:00,593
From what?

316
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:03,383
Word of the pestilence has not
reached you?

317
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:06,352
Word is all that has reached us.

318
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,716
Come.

319
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:20,964
What the hell is going on?

320
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,180
We need guile to draw out the necromancer.

321
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:33,762
No one acts unless I say so.

322
00:46:50,075 --> 00:46:52,066
Tonight we will feed you and
give you a bed.

323
00:46:52,388 --> 00:46:55,469
And in the morning we will escort you
to a safe part of the forest.

324
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,635
We're not welcome?

325
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,547
Of course.

326
00:47:00,264 --> 00:47:02,467
But why would you stay?

327
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:10,875
Here is some buckets,
you need to wash.

328
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:27,756
This is no time to be blinded by grief.

329
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:43,142
If this is hell,
can't wait for heaven.

330
00:47:43,466 --> 00:47:46,711
You're not bound for heaven, Swire.
Believe me.

331
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:16,792
I will tend to your wounds.

332
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:19,431
I will tend to your wound.

333
00:48:22,605 --> 00:48:24,843
That needs to be dressed.

334
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:28,791
- Come with me.
- Maybe you should get her seeing to.

335
00:48:57,413 --> 00:49:00,692
- Where are you from?
- From the monastery at Staveley.

336
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:04,987
You're in mourning.

337
00:49:05,205 --> 00:49:06,862
Is it so obvious?

338
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:10,384
Was it a woman?

339
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,657
It's no sin to love a woman.

340
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:15,381
I have sworn to god.

341
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:18,781
A man needs more
than divine love to sustain him.

342
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:21,858
And he shouldn't be punished
for wanting it.

343
00:49:24,324 --> 00:49:25,984
Do you have a husband?

344
00:49:26,203 --> 00:49:30,064
- My husband is dead.
- I am sorry.

345
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,823
Take off your clothes.

346
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:37,404
I need to dress your wound.

347
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:11,688
The pain is going already.

348
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,354
It's extraordinary,
the pain is gone.

349
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:16,723
It is a strong remedy.

350
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:24,022
May I ask you,
how did your husband die?

351
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,959
Men like you killed him.

352
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:28,383
Men like me?

353
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,890
Men of God.

354
00:51:08,852 --> 00:51:12,014
This church has not seen worship
for a long while.

355
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:40,012
- The woman you went with...
- She dressed my wounds, nothing more.

356
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,400
Nothing here is what it seems.

357
00:51:44,724 --> 00:51:46,762
You can help us keep warm, girls.

358
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:52,818
Child.

359
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:04,961
I found it.

360
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:08,175
Where?
- In the marsh.

361
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:18,794
Every village we rode through
had graveyards bursting.

362
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,135
No corpse-fueled pits,
no burning bodies.

363
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:24,914
We cannot judge them for having
no disease.

364
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:28,130
A party was send before us
charged with the same task.....

365
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,960
four men, none returned.

366
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:33,415
They were led by a man like myself.

367
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:39,500
This symbol is worn only
by the bishops envoy.

368
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:42,919
The girl wore its twin.

369
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:20,083
Please welcome our guests.
What is ours is now yours.

370
00:53:20,294 --> 00:53:22,452
- To our guests.
- "To our guest."

371
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:27,494
We also want to give thanks that we have
been spared the terrible pestilence...

372
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:30,244
sweeping through the land.

373
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:37,747
If I may...

374
00:53:39,457 --> 00:53:42,869
I would like to express
our gratitude for your welcome.

375
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:51,536
Now let us pray.

376
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:55,870
Pater noster qui es in caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.

377
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:58,241
Adveniat regnum tuum.

378
00:53:58,455 --> 00:54:02,067
Fiat voluntas tua,
sicut in caelo et in terra...

379
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,899
Panem nostrum
cotidianum da nobis hodie.

380
00:54:08,247 --> 00:54:14,361
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut
et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.

381
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:18,494
- Amen.
- Amen.

382
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:22,983
I expected grace
not the entire Lord's Prayer.

383
00:54:32,326 --> 00:54:37,656
Women outnumber men here.
Maybe that's why a woman speaks for them.

384
00:54:37,868 --> 00:54:40,022
Do not be fooled.

385
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:44,271
Evil works within this place,
within these people.

386
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:00,353
Osmund.

387
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:04,147
I just need some air.

388
00:55:15,697 --> 00:55:17,933
We found her in the forest.

389
00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:21,977
She spoke of you before she died.

390
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,894
Forgive me Lord. I am angry.

391
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:31,464
Why did you take her?

392
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,803
Why did you take her?

393
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,886
Osmund, where were you?

394
00:57:16,636 --> 00:57:18,544
Why did you betray me?

395
00:57:21,013 --> 00:57:22,670
Why?

396
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:26,332
Why did you betray me?

397
00:57:28,051 --> 00:57:30,336
Osmund? Osmund?

398
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:32,049
Osmund.

399
00:57:35,925 --> 00:57:37,121
Osmund?

400
00:57:37,341 --> 00:57:40,706
- What troubles you?
- We're to become beasts.

401
00:57:40,923 --> 00:57:43,874
We must become more than beasts
if we are to triumph here.

402
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:48,641
I see no evil here, just a simple village
that has not yet been ravished.

403
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:51,486
Leave a suffering to your heart
daunt your senses.

404
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:54,506
Sir, how would you know,
you have no heart to suffer.

405
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:56,752
I have known grief.

406
00:57:56,966 --> 00:57:59,997
My wife and child sit at God's side.

407
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:12,994
Yes...

408
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:16,624
this village is without the pestilence.

409
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,337
But it is also without God.

410
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:25,205
For this they will suffer.

411
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:55,788
Are you shy?

412
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:04,326
I am ugly and I am Christian.

413
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:07,286
And that is not a good combination
in here.

414
00:59:08,455 --> 00:59:10,242
Hm? Piss off.

415
00:59:28,827 --> 00:59:30,865
When will she be buried?

416
00:59:31,077 --> 00:59:34,190
Do not worry.
I will take care of everything.

417
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:36,615
Can I see her again?

418
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,612
You will.

419
00:59:48,703 --> 00:59:52,362
You were going to tell me
these men mean us harm.

420
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:54,945
Me in particular.

421
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:59,070
I knew the moment
I looked into Ulric's eyes.

422
00:59:59,284 --> 01:00:02,361
But I did not know
with whose side you were on.

423
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:05,737
Come with me.

424
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:10,862
Come.

425
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:46,733
What's going on?

426
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:49,471
Something you should see.

427
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:16,060
Now.

428
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:33,662
What's wrong?

429
01:03:34,795 --> 01:03:36,205
Get off.

430
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,577
Eat and drink.

431
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:13,157
As a Christian you will appreciate
the concept of betrayal.

432
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:11,445
Together...
Keep your head together.

433
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:12,986
- Keep it together.
- Get lost.

434
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:14,351
- Keep it together.
- Get lost.

435
01:05:14,351 --> 01:05:15,944
Keep your head together.

436
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:19,557
Stop. Piss off.

437
01:05:19,777 --> 01:05:23,770
You're not there boy.
Look at me boy. Look at me.

438
01:05:48,775 --> 01:05:50,979
Come on, boy.

439
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:06,056
Whore.

440
01:06:07,105 --> 01:06:09,012
Whore.

441
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:28,812
These Christians arrived in our village
claiming to seek refuge.

442
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:32,308
This was their true purpose.

443
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,057
They came uninvited to our home
bringing malice and hatred.

444
01:06:37,269 --> 01:06:39,721
These are God's gifts to us.

445
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:42,220
These are his words...

446
01:06:42,852 --> 01:06:46,099
and these fine men his ambassadors.

447
01:06:47,391 --> 01:06:52,050
Thirteen centuries of control
and intimidation...

448
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,214
now gaze back at us through those bars.

449
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:31,007
We do not relish suffering.

450
01:07:31,222 --> 01:07:33,888
We do what we must to keep us safe.

451
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:42,004
The pestilence, the Christian disease, send
by your god to ravage his own people.

452
01:07:42,218 --> 01:07:46,163
By spilling your Christian blood
the pestilence is kept away.

453
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:50,081
You and your flock,
you believe this blasphemous filth?

454
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:53,001
Kill us now, you bitch.
Get it over with.

455
01:07:53,216 --> 01:07:56,250
I will offer you all the chance to live.

456
01:07:58,008 --> 01:08:01,121
Renounce your vengeful God,
and you will be free.

457
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:04,957
Keep him and you will die.

458
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:08,288
Not one man here will bow down to you.

459
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:13,532
- I will die first.
- Who wants to live?

460
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,519
You?

461
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:20,463
I will fight Ulric
for the right to die first.

462
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:25,085
Choose one.

463
01:08:54,332 --> 01:08:56,453
You will renounce.

464
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:03,692
I look forward to shagging
your mother's ass in hell.

465
01:09:04,664 --> 01:09:09,782
My mother is alive and she doesn't relish
the company of soldiers.

466
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:15,872
Come on.

467
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:17,788
Come on, men.

468
01:09:17,998 --> 01:09:20,487
- Die well my friend.
- Oh, I will.

469
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:22,281
Come on.

470
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:26,193
My lady love and I,
we lived in joyous sin...

471
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:30,357
now my lady love has got
the blackened skin.

472
01:09:30,577 --> 01:09:34,359
Lady love and I,
we pour our love so brave...

473
01:09:34,579 --> 01:09:35,951
She says, yeah.

474
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,591
Now my lady love rots in an early grave.

475
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:43,854
My lady love and I,
we lived in joyous sin...

476
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:45,546
Now you will learn about pain.

477
01:09:45,763 --> 01:09:49,508
Nothing you can teach me about pain.

478
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:57,478
Don't look. Don't look.
Hey, look away.

479
01:09:57,696 --> 01:09:59,568
Look away, boy.

480
01:10:05,447 --> 01:10:10,153
Blood of our blood,
unholy trinity divine...

481
01:10:10,657 --> 01:10:14,435
we offer this lamb slaughtering down...

482
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:19,104
that death not ours shall stay afar.

483
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:25,814
For Christian blood, putrid and sick...

484
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:30,310
into our marsh shall weep.

485
01:10:54,982 --> 01:10:59,188
Bitch. You bitch.
I will fucking kill you, you bitch.

486
01:10:59,563 --> 01:11:02,515
I will slice you open. Do you hear me?

487
01:11:02,731 --> 01:11:06,099
I will fucking slice you open.
I don't fuck.

488
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:16,186
Choose another.

489
01:11:24,936 --> 01:11:26,977
I will renounce.

490
01:11:27,188 --> 01:11:29,428
No. No, you won't. You won't.

491
01:11:29,646 --> 01:11:33,341
You try to leave this...
I will kill you with my bare fucking hands.

492
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,261
I swear, I do.

493
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:37,438
No.

494
01:11:37,438 --> 01:11:41,001
Swire, listen to me.
If you renounce, you burn in hell.

495
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:45,242
- You...
- My Friend you will burn in hell.

496
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:51,675
He's going to kill you.

497
01:11:52,848 --> 01:11:55,965
I swear to god,
they're going to kill you.

498
01:11:56,598 --> 01:12:00,928
Swire, stop, no.... I swear to god,
they're going to kill you.

499
01:12:15,973 --> 01:12:19,670
God, begone.
I do renounce thee eternally.

500
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:29,499
God, begone.

501
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,922
I do renounce thee eternally.

502
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:35,002
Holy Ghost, begone eternally.

503
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:38,717
Holy Ghost, begone eternally.

504
01:12:38,929 --> 01:12:42,210
Christ, begone eternally.

505
01:12:44,718 --> 01:12:46,507
Christ...

506
01:12:46,717 --> 01:12:48,672
begone eternally.

507
01:12:48,882 --> 01:12:51,714
The false idols have been cast out.

508
01:12:53,464 --> 01:12:55,620
God is gone.

509
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:58,793
The Holy Ghost is gone.

510
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,876
Christ is gone.

511
01:13:04,802 --> 01:13:08,045
These men will escort you
to the edge of the village.

512
01:13:08,257 --> 01:13:10,212
You are free to go.

513
01:13:18,484 --> 01:13:20,625
Where we going?

514
01:13:20,838 --> 01:13:22,357
Where we going?

515
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:25,272
Where are we go...
Aaahhh.

516
01:13:25,272 --> 01:13:26,419
No.

517
01:13:38,336 --> 01:13:40,124
Osmund.

518
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:44,993
- You will renounce.
- Leave the boy. Leave the boy.

519
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:48,869
Leave the boy and take a man.

520
01:13:49,082 --> 01:13:51,237
He's a boy.

521
01:13:52,082 --> 01:13:54,752
He's a boy. He's a boy.

522
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:06,368
This monk came to restore our faith.

523
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:10,157
Today he will abandon his own.

524
01:14:11,165 --> 01:14:13,996
Inside that cottage is the woman he loves.

525
01:14:14,206 --> 01:14:18,613
- I have brought her back to him.
- God, I am dead, I am in hell.

526
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:22,905
No Osmund, you left hell behind
when you crossed our marsh.

527
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:26,567
Come live here with us.

528
01:14:26,785 --> 01:14:29,157
Come live with the woman you love.

529
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,360
We have no fury.

530
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:34,824
We have no pestilence.
We have no God.

531
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:38,067
Why are you doing this to me?

532
01:14:38,284 --> 01:14:40,488
Because I like you.

533
01:14:45,326 --> 01:14:47,811
Renounce, and you will be together.

534
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:50,146
Go.

535
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:52,483
Go.

536
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,447
Osmund. Osmund.

537
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:01,613
Do not be tempted.

538
01:15:01,826 --> 01:15:05,237
It is not her.
It is not her.

539
01:15:06,616 --> 01:15:08,072
Osmund.

540
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:09,654
Osmund.

541
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:17,884
Averill.

542
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:24,895
No, come here.

543
01:16:26,897 --> 01:16:28,436
No, Averill.

544
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:45,971
Averill, look at me.

545
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,550
It is alright.

546
01:16:58,269 --> 01:17:00,056
It's alright.

547
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:02,223
You're with God.

548
01:17:02,433 --> 01:17:04,423
You're with God.

549
01:17:05,891 --> 01:17:09,551
And very soon, I will be with you.
I promise you.

550
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:12,883
I promise you.

551
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:29,216
I love you, Averill.

552
01:17:32,595 --> 01:17:34,751
In nomine patris...

553
01:17:34,968 --> 01:17:37,041
et filii...

554
01:17:37,259 --> 01:17:39,965
et spiritus sancti. Amen.

555
01:19:01,668 --> 01:19:04,119
Averill is with God.

556
01:19:05,957 --> 01:19:08,113
And so am I.

557
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:14,113
This shows how cruel they are.

558
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,992
Even the ones they love
are slaughtered in God's name.

559
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:31,911
The boy will not renounce.
He will not renounce.

560
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:35,529
You have no power here.
You have no power here.

561
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,074
Hob, crucify them all.

562
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:44,495
You can not tear a true man of God
away from his faith.

563
01:19:45,203 --> 01:19:49,147
I do not fear you, nor your pagan lapdog.

564
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,443
Finished?

565
01:19:54,078 --> 01:19:56,068
Bring out the horses.

566
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:11,443
Crucify us and you shall be spared.

567
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:15,152
That is the creed of your witch.

568
01:20:15,363 --> 01:20:18,277
You came to our land bringing death.

569
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:21,154
For once you speak the truth.

570
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:24,030
We came bringing death.

571
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:28,141
She cannot protect you from God's wrath.

572
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:32,231
Repent. Before it is too late.

573
01:20:32,656 --> 01:20:34,313
Hit it.

574
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,188
Repent.

575
01:20:51,902 --> 01:20:53,894
You will renounce.

576
01:20:55,025 --> 01:20:56,306
Never.

577
01:21:01,108 --> 01:21:03,431
No. No.

578
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:09,358
Never.

579
01:21:36,232 --> 01:21:37,772
Stop.

580
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:52,885
Let me see the boy.

581
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:16,759
You did well.

582
01:22:20,054 --> 01:22:21,966
Come on, come on, come.

583
01:22:25,348 --> 01:22:28,133
They will all die by God's hand.

584
01:22:31,723 --> 01:22:33,843
Open my shirt.

585
01:22:38,803 --> 01:22:41,040
Open my shirt.

586
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,215
I am Death.

587
01:23:01,718 --> 01:23:03,375
Vengeance is mine.

588
01:23:06,257 --> 01:23:10,083
God's fury rains down on you.

589
01:23:10,922 --> 01:23:13,079
God is restored.

590
01:23:17,837 --> 01:23:19,584
Run.

591
01:24:04,624 --> 01:24:06,530
Where are you?

592
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:59,519
- Hell awaits you with open arms.
- There is no hell.

593
01:25:59,734 --> 01:26:03,264
- Well, heaven doesn't want you.
- There is no heaven.

594
01:26:03,482 --> 01:26:06,929
Why, why follow her?

595
01:26:07,149 --> 01:26:09,900
Because she was beautiful.

596
01:26:10,902 --> 01:26:12,938
And real.

597
01:26:13,152 --> 01:26:15,306
This...

598
01:26:15,524 --> 01:26:17,682
is real.

599
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:31,720
There..... is.... no..... God.

600
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:38,435
Where are you?

601
01:26:51,601 --> 01:26:53,307
Where are you?

602
01:26:55,392 --> 01:26:57,762
Thou shall not kill...

603
01:26:57,976 --> 01:26:59,883
Remember?

604
01:27:01,308 --> 01:27:03,013
Remember?

605
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:05,846
Averill was in purgatory.

606
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,548
Perhaps in your twisted mind.

607
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:12,181
Did you never think that maybe
Averill was never dead?

608
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:18,463
We found her in the forest,
injured but very much alive.

609
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:20,555
You know that is not true.

610
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:25,088
Yes, Osmund. Averill was never dead.
She was alive.

611
01:27:26,556 --> 01:27:28,594
I drugged her.

612
01:27:29,599 --> 01:27:31,469
I drugged her.

613
01:27:43,638 --> 01:27:45,010
So why... why...

614
01:27:45,221 --> 01:27:48,170
Why would you do that?
Why would you bury her?

615
01:27:48,383 --> 01:27:50,921
Because people need miracles.

616
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:55,459
And they worship the miracle makers,
whoever they might be.

617
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:02,710
The people in this village believed in me.

618
01:28:02,928 --> 01:28:06,376
- And so did you.
- No, Averill was dead.

619
01:28:06,594 --> 01:28:08,832
You killed her.

620
01:28:10,761 --> 01:28:12,715
Averill was dead.

621
01:28:20,922 --> 01:28:22,713
She was dead.

622
01:28:28,964 --> 01:28:31,001
Bring her back.

623
01:28:33,046 --> 01:28:35,795
I beg you, bring her back.

624
01:28:37,088 --> 01:28:39,707
No, I can't.

625
01:28:40,213 --> 01:28:42,119
Pray to your God.

626
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:45,080
See what he can do.

627
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:55,783
She was dead.

628
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:27,408
There is nothing beautiful or uplifting
in returning people to God.

629
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:33,195
There is no place in heaven
for those who kill.

630
01:29:35,914 --> 01:29:39,610
The pestilence claimed no higher purpose.

631
01:29:39,828 --> 01:29:46,073
And those who had survived our swords
that day soon fell foul of its sighs.

632
01:29:47,577 --> 01:29:50,860
They were not protected by the witch.

633
01:29:51,075 --> 01:29:53,445
They were simply remote.

634
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:57,575
And once the pestilence
crossed their marsh...

635
01:29:58,244 --> 01:30:00,568
it killed them too.

636
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:22,405
Osmund.

637
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:25,237
Osmund.

638
01:30:27,362 --> 01:30:28,940
We're here.

639
01:30:43,236 --> 01:30:45,025
Osmund.

640
01:30:48,608 --> 01:30:51,778
That you have returned safe is a miracle.

641
01:30:54,298 --> 01:30:55,498
Who is that?

642
01:30:55,498 --> 01:30:58,520
It's a necromancer
that I will be delivering to the bishop.

643
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:03,183
Here, that's...

644
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:14,524
How many of you are left.

645
01:31:14,524 --> 01:31:16,014
Enough.

646
01:31:18,274 --> 01:31:20,099
Look after him.

647
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:23,220
There's no need.

648
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,888
He is back with God.

649
01:31:47,647 --> 01:31:50,560
I never saw him again.

650
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:53,721
I heard stories.

651
01:31:53,938 --> 01:31:55,894
Dark stories.

652
01:31:56,978 --> 01:32:02,429
That in the years that followed
Osmond’s heart turned cold.

653
01:32:02,641 --> 01:32:06,967
That in the shadow of his grief
he found a hate.

654
01:32:07,185 --> 01:32:08,929
And that in God's name...

655
01:32:09,142 --> 01:32:14,473
he took up the sword
and vengeance became his creed.

656
01:32:20,598 --> 01:32:22,505
Can I help you?

657
01:32:40,262 --> 01:32:41,837
Please.

658
01:32:42,677 --> 01:32:44,086
Please.

659
01:32:46,766 --> 01:32:49,086
I have done nothing wrong.

660
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,969
Please.

661
01:32:53,264 --> 01:32:54,304
Please.

662
01:32:57,222 --> 01:32:59,754
You have the wrong woman.

663
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:05,294
I want a confession,
and I want her alive.

664
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:50,753
Osmund.

665
01:33:51,254 --> 01:33:52,996
She won't confess.

666
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:55,580
Are you sure she's a witch?

667
01:34:02,127 --> 01:34:04,248
Where is she?

668
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:13,452
Some say he found the witch...

669
01:34:13,665 --> 01:34:16,747
and that he tortured her
and burned her.

670
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:24,071
Others say it was never her...

671
01:34:26,706 --> 01:34:31,030
it was only her guilt he saw
in the eyes of the accused.

672
01:34:47,177 --> 01:34:48,531
Let me go.

673
01:34:57,369 --> 01:34:59,740
I like to think that he found peace...

674
01:35:01,203 --> 01:35:04,154
that he continued
seeing beauty in the world...

675
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:07,011
....Goodness.
